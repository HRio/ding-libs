/* IMPORTANT - the collection is a set of items of different type.
 * There is always a header item in any collection that starts the collection.
 * Most of the functions in the interface (unless explicitly stated otherwise)
 * assume that the collection_item * argument points to the header element.
 * Passing in elements extracted from the middle of a collection to functions
 * that expect header elements is illegal. There might be not enough checking
 * at the moment but this will be enforced in future versions of the library.

 * IMPORTANT - To better understand how collections work imagine travel bags.
 * They usually come in different sizes and one can put a bag in a bag when
 * they put away to the shelf in a garage or closet. Collection is such bag
 * except that you can put other bags into each other even if they are not
 * empty.
 * When you put items into a bag you do not see the contents of the bag.
 * You just hold the bag. How many other bags inside this bag you do not know.
 * But you might know that you put a "valet" somewhere there.
 * You ask the bag you hold: "find my valet and give it to me".
 * get_item function will return you the item that is you "valet".
 * You can then change something or just get information about the item you
 * retrieved. But in most cases you do not the valet itself. You want to get
 * something from the vallet or put something into it. IMO money would be an
 * obvious choice. To do this you use update_xxx_property functions.
 * There might be a bag somewhere deep and you might want to add something to
 * it. add_xxx_property_xxx functions allow you to specify sub collection you
 * want the item to be added to. If this sub collection argument is NULL top
 * level collection is assumed.
 * The search in the collections users a dotted notation to refer to an item (or
 * property). You can search for "valet" and it will find any first instance of
 * the "valet" in your luggage. But you might have two valets. One is yours and
 * another is your significant other's. So you might say find "my.valet".
 * It will find valet in your bad (collection) named "my". This collection can
 * be many levels deep inside other collections. You do not need to know the
 * full path to get to it. But if you have the full path you can use the fill
 * path like this "luggage.newbags.my.valet".
 * It is useful to be able to put bags into bags as well as get them out of each
 * other. When the collection is created the header keeps a reference count on
 * how many copies of the collection are known to the world. So one can put a
 * collection into collection and give up its access to it (embed) of still hold
 * to the reference. By embedding the collection the caller effectively gives
 * up its responsibility to destroy the collection after it is used.
 * By extracting reference from an internal collection the caller gains access
 * to the collection directly and thus has responsibility to destroy it after
 * use.
